- Inspiration

 in the past there was no easy way to understand whether certain unit pricing is making sense or not. With this dataset, I wanted to be able to answer the following questions:

- What are the biggest factor affecting the unit/rent pricing?
- here we want to analyze Mellbourne data to cover points:
- Which suburbs are the best to buy in?
- Which ones are value for money?
- Where's the expensive side of town?
- where should I buy a 2 bedroom unit?
